Problem Statement:-

	Email, newsgroup and messaging applications provide means for communication among people but these are one-way mechanisms and 
	they do not provide an easy way to carry on a real-time conversation or discussion with people involved. 
	Chat room extends the one-way messaging concept to accommodate multi-way communication among a set of people.
	Chat rooms have become a popular way to support a forum for n-way conversation or discussion among a set of people with 
	interest in a common topic. 
	Chat applications range from simple, text-based ones to entire virtual worlds with exotic graphics.

Solution:-
	In this project we are implementing a simple text-based chat client/server application.
	This project is to create a chat application with a server and users to unable the users to chat with each other.
	To develop an instant messaging solution to enable users to seamlessly communicate with each other.
	The chat application we are going to make will be more like a chat room, rather than a peer to peer chat. 
	So this means that multiple users can connect to the chat server and send their messages. 
	Every message is broadcasted to every connected chat user 
	This project is very easy to use enabling even a novice person to use it.
