Problem Statement:-
	Actual Problem in our software project:
    In our game the objects are moving automatically without any user interaction.
    Also there is no choice given to user to select or exit the game.
    There is no feature of choosing any option rather the user has to type the upcoming processess.

Solution:-
	We will be using multithreading for proper visualisation and orientation of instances for improving user interaction.
  We will use modules and libraries both user defined and pre-defined.
