Problem Statement:-

	->Email, newsgroup and messaging applications provide means for communication among people but these are one-way mechanisms and 
	  they do not provide an easy way to carry on a real-time conversation or discussion with people involved. 
	->Suppose you have to use a chat application where multiple users can chat together.
	->Rather than each user sending the message directly to other users,we can use mediator pattern to implement this design.
	->The problem with the internet messaging is Data loss or viewed by third party while transferring data or infromation.
	->Some untrusted staff will denial the task that given to them,take time to receive the data or information through internet.
	->Chat room extends the one-way messaging concept to accommodate multi-way communication among a set of people.
	->Chat rooms have become a popular way to support a forum for n-way conversation or discussion among a set of people with 
	  interest in a common topic. 
	->Chat applications range from simple, text-based ones to entire virtual worlds with exotic graphics.

Solution:-
	->In this project we are implementing a simple text-based chat client/server application.
	->This project is to create a chat application with a server and users to unable the users to chat with each other.
	->To develop an instant messaging solution to enable users to seamlessly communicate with each other.
	->The chat application we are going to make will be more like a chat room, rather than a peer to peer chat. 
	->So this means that multiple users can connect to the chat server and send their messages. 
	->Every message is broadcasted to every connected chat user 
	->This project is very easy to use enabling even a novice person to use it.
