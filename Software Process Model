In the system development, there are number of methodologies, known as SDLC (System Development Life Cycle), which can be applied such 
as Waterfall, Evolutionary Development and Component-Based Software Engineering. The selected-approach reflects the success of the system.

In the waterfall model, the system development process cascades from one phase to another.
It comprises six phases, namely:
1.Phase one : System Planning
2.Phase two : Problem Analysis
3.Phase three : System Design
4.Phase four : System Implementation
5.Phase five : System Testing
6.Phase six : Operation and Maintenance

In Figure 1 shows the waterfall sequential model from one phase to the next in a cascading method.It means the following phase should
not start until the previous phase has finished. For instance, one first completes systems planning, which are set in stone. 
When the requirements are fully completed,one proceeds to problem analysis. Next, after the problem analyses are fully completed, 
it goes to system design. When the design is fully completed, a system implementation of that design is made by coders. 
During the final life-cycle phase, the software is put into use. Errors and omissions are discovered.Therefore, the waterfall model
maintains that one should move to a phase only when itâ€™s proceeding phase is completed and perfected.
